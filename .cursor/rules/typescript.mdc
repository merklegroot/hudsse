## Semicolons
Use semicolons to terminate statements.

## Function Declarations
Prefer function declarations over const arrow functions for methods *especially* with exports.
This makes jest unit test mocking more flexible.

Exceptions to this include when it there's a concern about behavior with `this`.

## Boolean Naming
Boolean variable names should be phrased as questions using verbs.
This makes the code more readable and self-documenting.

Examples:
``` text
wasSuccessful
isCompleted
hasPermission
canExecute
```

## Control Flow
Ternaries are often best for simple conditionals.
Avoid `else if` chains when possible.
Prefer early returns, guard clauses, or switch statements for better readability.
Exception: Use `else if` only when it eliminates code duplication.

## Switch Statements
Don't use switch statements in TypeScript/JavaScript.
In other languages that support pattern matching, the pattern matching switch statment can be ok.

## Code Nesting
Minimize nesting levels to improve readability.
Use early returns, extract functions, or refactor conditions to reduce complexity.

## Cross-Platform Concerns
When splitting lines, do so in a way that works with the major EOL formats, including \n, \r, and \r\n
When creating a line break, make sure to use the proper EOL format for the platform.
Note that this sometimes may not apply to text that's rendered in the browser, as browsers on all platforms (even Windows) use \n.
When joining paths, please do so in context of the OS's path format.
